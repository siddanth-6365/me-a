# 🏗️ Framework Notes: Atlan Apps Framework

**Challenges, Patterns, and Insights from Building SourceSense**

This document captures the interesting challenges, patterns, and insights encountered while building SourceSense using the Atlan Apps Framework.

## 🎯 **Framework Overview**

The Atlan Apps Framework provides a comprehensive foundation for building data applications with:
- **Temporal-based workflow orchestration**
- **Dapr for distributed state management**
- **Built-in observability (logging, metrics, tracing)**
- **Activity-based architecture**
- **Production-ready infrastructure**

## 🚧 **Key Challenges Encountered**

### **1. Observability Decorator Integration**

**Challenge**: Understanding how the `@observability` decorator works with Temporal workflows and activities.

**Pattern Discovered**:
```python
# The decorator must be applied at the class level for workflows
@observability(logger=logger, metrics=metrics, traces=traces)
@workflow.run
async def run(self, workflow_config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Workflow implementation
```

**Key Insights**:
- The decorator intercepts method calls and automatically instruments them
- It requires all three components: logger, metrics, and traces
- The decorator handles correlation IDs and distributed tracing automatically
- Metrics are automatically generated (success/failure counts, execution time)

**Best Practice**: Always apply the decorator to the main workflow method, not individual activities.

### **2. Activity Method Decoration**

**Challenge**: Understanding the difference between `@activity.defn` and regular async methods.

**Pattern Discovered**:
```python
class SourceSenseActivities(ActivitiesInterface):
    @activity.defn  # Required for Temporal activity execution
    async def test_database_connection(self, connection_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Activity implementation
    
    def _build_connection_url(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        # Regular method - not decorated
        # Used internally by activities
```

**Key Insights**:
- Only methods that need to be executed by Temporal need `@activity.defn`
- Helper methods should not be decorated
- The decorator enables retry logic, timeouts, and error handling
- Activities must be serializable (no complex objects in parameters)

**Best Practice**: Keep activities focused and use helper methods for complex logic.

### **3. Workflow-Activity Communication**

**Challenge**: Understanding how workflows and activities communicate and share data.

**Pattern Discovered**:
```python
# Workflow calls activities with parameters
connection_test = await workflow.execute_activity(
    activities_instance.test_database_connection,
    connection_config,  # Direct parameter passing
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
)

# Activities return structured data
return {
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Database connection successful",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

**Key Insights**:
- Data is passed directly as parameters (no shared state)
- Return values must be serializable
- Use structured return formats for consistency
- Activities are stateless and can be retried independently

**Best Practice**: Use consistent return formats and include timestamps for debugging.

### **4. Error Handling and Recovery**

**Challenge**: Implementing proper error handling across workflows and activities.

**Pattern Discovered**:
```python
# Activity-level error handling
try:
    # Activity logic
    return {"status": "success", "data": result}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Activity failed: {str(e)}")
    return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

# Workflow-level error handling
if connection_test.get("status") != "success":
    logger.error("Database connection failed, stopping workflow")
    results["status"] = "failed"
    results["error"] = "Database connection failed"
    return results
```

**Key Insights**:
- Activities should catch exceptions and return error status
- Workflows should check activity results and decide on continuation
- Use structured error responses for consistent handling
- Log errors at both activity and workflow levels

**Best Practice**: Always return structured responses, even for errors.

### **5. Configuration Management**

**Challenge**: Managing configuration across different environments and components.

**Pattern Discovered**:
```python
# Configuration is passed through workflow parameters
workflow_config = {
    "workflow_id": "test-123",
    "connection_config": {
        "database_type": "postgresql",
        "host": "localhost",
        # ... other config
    },
    "analysis_options": {
        "test_only": False,
        "analyze_data_quality": True
    }
}
```

**Key Insights**:
- Configuration is passed as workflow parameters
- No built-in configuration management (rely on external systems)
- Use structured configuration objects
- Validate configuration in activities

**Best Practice**: Use typed configuration objects and validate early.

## 🔄 **Interesting Patterns Discovered**

### **1. Activity Sequence Pattern**

**Pattern**: Activities are executed in a specific sequence with dependency management.

```python
# Sequential execution with dependency checking
connection_test = await workflow.execute_activity(...)
if connection_test.get("status") != "success":
    return results  # Stop on failure

schema_metadata = await workflow.execute_activity(...)
if schema_metadata.get("status") == "error":
    return results  # Stop on error

sensitive_data = await workflow.execute_activity(...)
# Continue with next activity
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear execution flow
- Early failure detection
- Easy to add new steps
- Natural error handling

### **2. Result Aggregation Pattern**

**Pattern**: Collecting results from multiple activities into a final result set.

```python
results = {
    "workflow_id": workflow_config.get("workflow_id"),
    "status": "running",
    "steps_completed": [],
    "connection_test": None,
    "schema_metadata": None,
    "sensitive_data": None,
    "data_quality": None,
    "execution_summary": {}
}

# Populate results as activities complete
results["connection_test"] = connection_test
results["steps_completed"].append("connection_test")
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear result structure
- Easy to track progress
- Simple to extend
- Good for debugging

### **3. Conditional Execution Pattern**

**Pattern**: Conditionally executing activities based on configuration or previous results.

```python
# Conditional data quality analysis
if analysis_options.get("analyze_data_quality", False):
    logger.info("Step 4: Analyzing data quality")
    # Execute data quality analysis
    results["data_quality"] = quality_analyses
    results["steps_completed"].append("data_quality_analysis")
```

**Benefits**:
- Flexible execution paths
- Performance optimization
- User-controlled features
- Easy to add new options

### **4. Batch Processing Pattern**

**Pattern**: Processing multiple items (tables) in batches to avoid timeouts.

```python
# Process tables in batches
tables_to_analyze = []
max_tables = analysis_options.get("max_tables_for_quality_analysis", 5)

for schema in schema_metadata.get("schemas", [])[:2]:
    for table in schema.get("tables", [])[:max_tables]:
        tables_to_analyze.append(table_info)
        if len(tables_to_analyze) >= max_tables:
            break

# Process each table
for table_info in tables_to_analyze:
    quality_result = await workflow.execute_activity(...)
    quality_analyses.append(quality_result)
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents timeouts
- Memory efficient
- Configurable limits
- Progress tracking

## 🎨 **Framework-Specific Insights**

### **1. Temporal Integration**

**Insight**: Temporal provides excellent reliability but requires understanding of its execution model.

**Key Points**:
- Activities are executed by workers (can be different processes)
- Workflows are deterministic and can be replayed
- State is managed by Temporal, not your application
- Use `workflow.execute_activity` for activity calls

### **2. Dapr Integration**

**Insight**: Dapr components are configured but not actively used in the current implementation.

**Current State**:
- Components are defined in `components/` folder
- No active Dapr client usage in application code
- State management is handled by Temporal
- Future enhancement opportunity

### **3. Observability Integration**

**Insight**: The observability system is powerful but requires careful setup.

**Key Points**:
- Logger, metrics, and traces must be initialized before use
- The decorator automatically instruments methods
- Correlation IDs are handled automatically
- Metrics include success/failure counts and execution time

### **4. Application Lifecycle**

**Insight**: The application lifecycle is well-defined but requires understanding of the startup sequence.

**Startup Sequence**:
1. Initialize observability components
2. Create BaseApplication instance
3. Setup workflow and activities
4. Start worker
5. Setup server
